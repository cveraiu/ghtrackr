Application created with the objective of completing the technical test for Fulltime Force with a date of October 2023. This application allows you to view the commit history that a repository has had over time.
Getting Started

    Install Node.js: Go to https://nodejs.org/en to download the latest version of Node.js (skip this step if you already have it installed).

-- From the next step onwards, you need to be in the project folder. Navigate to it and open a new instance of your terminal (CMD/Powershell/Bash).

    Install dependencies: Install the dependencies using the command "npm install".

    Build the application: Build the application using the command "npm run build".

    Start the application: Launch the application using the command "npm run start".
    -- If you encounter the error "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000," it means another application is running on port 3000.
    -- First, close that application, and then use the command "npm run start" again.

    Open the application: To open the application, go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

And there you go! üòä You can now use the application.
Please keep in mind that the GitHub API has a usage limit per user, so it's normal for it to stop displaying results after some time of use. üôÅ
